Actos,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Have been on Actos for almost a year, gained 24 pounds and have swelling in hands and feet and are retaining a lot of water in my thighs.  My sugar levels are good.  My doctor lowered my dosage from 30 mg to 15 mg but refused to take me off.  Will get a second opinion because the side effects are too much."""
Afrezza,"Diabetes, Type 1","""Since I was on the trials I put 6+ months but I have been back on Afrezza for about 2 weeks.  Afrezza is nothing short of a miracle. I am a type 1 diabetic and my blood sugar average in the past 10 days has been 110. I have a CGM so I have had 2880 readings in the past 10 days.  A 110 average equals to an A1C of 5.45. This is possible because Afrezza mimics the speed of a healthy pancreas. Afrezza starts working in only 12-15 minutes and works out of my system very quickly. This allows me to manage my glucose in real time without babysitting diabetes all day. Even if I do have a high I can knock my sugars back to 100 in a matter of minutes."""

Liraglutide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I have been taking Victoza for about a month. Started at 0.6mg for the first two weeks and lost about 3 pounds. Increased to 1.2mg after two weeks and have lost an extra 9 pounds for a total of twelve pounds the first month. My main complaint is a little upset stomach and a little diarrhea. But I can handle it for the sake of weight loss. I seriously cannot eat no where near as much as before.  I used to be able to eat 6 pieces of a papa John&#039;s large pizza in one sitting. Now I can barely eat 2 without the crust. I have waaaaayyyy more energy now. I don&#039;t understand how some people are having problems with injection site.

Dulaglutide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I started this 4wks ago.  I have lost weight and sugars are down.  The side effects are awful and almost unbearable.  I hate it.  I called the doctor and told her I have indigestion from hell gas, stomach bloating, explosive diaharra, nausea. She said to hang in there it will get better.  I took the last shot today and already feeling the side effects.  I want to know why the hell a company would make medicine like this.  I will never take this again.  Very displeased"""
Canagliflozin,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Took 100 mg Invokana for three weeks and blood sugar readings dropped dramatically even after reducing insulin dosage.

Life moves on with one less concern."""
Trulicity,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I started this injectible over a a year ago and am stopping it on my doctor&#039;s advice.  After all the usual start up symptoms went away after a few weeks, the medication did seem to work, but as time went on it seemed to not work as well. Also, my hair started to thin out and fall out, mildly, and I have Tinnitus and it definitely made it worse, making it very loud. I also started having problems with my liver, gastritis and my thyroid has almost completely stopped working, so now I have to be on Synthroid! Make sure your doctor checks your thyroid at times.TO THE LADY WITH THE NEW STENTS= I have fourteen stents, no problem whatsoever. I also found it helped with the weakness if I ate first thing in the morning."""
Dulaglutide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Just took my 8th injection of .75 Trulicity today.  It has been amazing.  I always had trouble with my sugars and would get horrible welts from Levemir.  Doctor switched me from Levemir to Tresiba (62 units each morning) and the difference has been amazing.  I have GERD so all I can report is that it definitely has not been worse.  My sugars used to run around 230 to 323 most of the time.  Now they are from about 65 to 130.  If I&#039;m under 80, I don&#039;t take any short-acting, which is Novolog for me.  I&#039;ve lost about 7 pounds and my cravings are a thing of the past.  I am on SSDI and with prior-authorization from my endocrinologist, Medicare has authorized payment.  If it ever doesn&#039;t, Trulicity and I will part ways."""
Metformin,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Many subtle side effects that clear over time.  Chance of infection side effect is curious as that is a condition to be religiously avoided with diabetes of any type.  Also since starting Metformin I have red skin on right leg that seems to never go away.  More than a coincidence I think that this appeared right after starting this medication.  I am finding controlling my diet and exercise a much better solution than current drugs but will take for a while longer."""
Exubera,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I thought it was pretty awesome stuff, but thanks to 6

Now I get to stab myself a few times a day to stay alive. Such fun. 6 out of 4000! Really? 0.15%? What a shame. % of Americans with lung cancer in 2008 was 7.3%."""
Dulaglutide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""On my third week and for me have suffered few ill effects. I was quite concerned about using the Trulicity after reading these many rather negative reviews. But, I decided to try it as the injection method is fantastically simple. 
I for whatever reason cannot inject myself with insulin. My wife had to do it daily, something she was not crazy about. 
Now, once a week and a hidden needle it is very very easy now.
So far I have not experienced any of these other symptoms except a brief feeling of nausea. Nothing really bad at all.
So for me this is great. My glucose numbers have dropped quite a bit and at the moment just above where I want to be. (Around 150 - I was much higher before even with insulin at around 190-sh).
Also taking Junovia.."""
Dapagliflozin,"Diabetes, Type 2","""(on for 4 months) Worked well so I did not take as much insulin - had one yeast infection that stopped after fluconazole-I did NOT lose weight despite eating better with this. Major side effect of hair loss so I am stopping - my numbers were fine before this and the hair loss (and crappy texture) is so not worth it...doctor never mentioned hair loss as a side effect."""
Dulaglutide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I have been taking Trulicity for 12 weeks and lost 8lbs and my sugars are the lowest they have ever been. I have not had an A1C done since I started this medication but I am sure it has dropped. I do experience some of the side effects such as nausea and tiredness and I have no appetite at all and when I do eat I am full very quickly. I am on the higher dose and I have reduced the amount of Lantus I take by 20units daily. I do experience morning lows a lot more but a glass of OJ helps. I am anxious to see my doctor and get an A1C done."""

Victoza,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I have been taking Victoza 1.2mg for about a year along with 1000mg Metformin 2x per day. When I first started it I was on the 0.6mg dose and I had zero side effects but since upping to 1.2mg I have had constant nausea and very little appetite. I occasionally will get powerful sulfur burps followed by vomiting. The medicine does keep my sugar under control, my last A1C was 6.0. """
Metformin,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Diagnosed as &quot;pre-diabetic&quot;, A1C 5.9. GP said my triglycerides high and prescribed metformin 500 mg twice a day.

1 pill a day had no obvious side effects. Adding pill #2 gave diarrhea if taken at the same time. So I shifted pill #2 to lunch and it gave diarrhea after 2 days in a row.

So I worked my way up to 2 a day. Mon &amp; Thur for month. Mon/Wed/Fri for a month.  Etc.

My A1C is now 5.3-5.7, with my insurance the generic is super cheap  (less than $1/month), and if I have diarrhea for any reason I skip the 2nd daily pill.

Metformin is working fine for me."""
Exenatide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""On the package, it clearly states, that of the view of the medication does not like it shows in the booklet, then discard it.

Dulaglutide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I started .75 dose in November of 2016. It immediately curbed my appetite and helped me lose 37 lbs by Feb 2017. There is a little stomach discomfort sometimes but its not too bad. There is also constipation for about 3 days each week, but I believe its from the colon not moving anything. The med slows digestion. My experience with the med is positive, much more than with Bydureon. That&#039;s was a nightmare. I recently went to a low carb high fat diet and its working even better now. I hope this helps someone out there. PS, And don&#039;t let the doc start you on the higher dose. Ask for samples or rebates because most insurers don&#039;t cover it."""
Liraglutide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Have been on Victoza for 6  weeks at this time, at the 1.2 dosage.  Experienced the nausea, however, it has subsided, no noticeable headaches, definitely lowered by blood sugars, morning and night times.  Have lost 22 lbs so far.

Exenatide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""So far I am very pleased with my results from taking Bydureon for some 4 months.  I have lost 8 kgs and my Hba1C has gone from 8.9 to 7.   I have lumps but they do gradually go after a period of time, have had some bruising also.   My main concern is the nausea which I still experience spasmodically and absolute lack of appetite.  Certain foods I only have to look at and it is a real turn off.   But I will put up with all the above as I have finally lost some weight by eating minute amounts 6 times a day and my Blood Sugars are the lowest they have been for approximately 3 years and it is so rewarding to hear friends say &quot;you have lost weight, you look great&quot;"""
Insulin lispro,"Diabetes, Type 2","""My insurance company changed to Humalog KwikPen; my short response - IT SUCKS!

Guess I go back to my almost carb free diet."""

After a year there is 45 lbs less of me :) and my desire to be active/healthy again has returned.
I will encourage those that Victoza alone is not solely the answer.....I have family members who also went on Victoza, did not follow diet/exercise and or portion control and the drug only made them feel worse and had no effects. I personally found Victoza a great tool in combo with portion/diet/exercise to truly be the answer I&#039;d been waiting for! Worth a try if you are serious..."""

Blood pressure readings have dropped to normal range. I&#039;ve always had issues with male yeast infections and was concerned when I first started this medicine. I apply a steriod/antifungal cream at the slightest hint of redness, this has kept the issue under control. The more sugar you consume, the more you will urinate. I think I have mentally reduced my sugar intake just knowing that. I&#039;ve lost over 30lbs also."""
Canagliflozin,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Been on it about 5 weeks. 300mg. No yeast infections. Yes peeing more, but for me it is a more normal amount. Before I had to force myself to drink, rarely felt real thirst,  and always felt I retained water especially from eating carbs. Now I drink more and pee more, but manageable. Once at night only.  The best thing I noticed is more energy and slow but sure weight loss on a more normal amount of food. Lost 8lbs so far and waking up in the morning is easier.  More energy means more exercise too. So far, so good. Love it, feel more normal like I did when I was younger"""
Canagliflozin,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I have been type 1 diabetic for 28 years diagnosed at 12 years old, have been on insulin 28 years, 6 years on a pump.  I joined a research study in Nov. 2014, to test Invokana on type 1 diabetics to see if it could help type 1&#039;s.  I am so amazed and happy with this medication!  I have cut down on my insulin a lot, only 9 units of basal for the day!  I lost 6 pounds.  I feel and look great lots more energy.  Yes there is a genital itch problem, I also had hives, which I believe it worth it for great blood sugars and weight loss.  Lucky I am born and raised in Canada where our health insurance covers the cost completely."""
Liraglutide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""My HbAC1 was at 8.5 and I tried many medicine for 4 years and without great success.   I started using Victoza 7 weeks ago.   First 2 weeks, I used 0.6mg and it did not do much for me, hardly noticed the difference.    I increased to 1.2mg the following week.   I try to remember, but I did not remember much side effect.   I did have bruising at the injection site about 4 times, if you even call that side effect.   The morning blood sugar came normal around 7.2.   I lost only 2 kilograms(4 lb) for the fist 30 days.    On the fifth week, I went to 1.8mg.   Now I really start to feel there is no appetite.   I eat every 2 hours for some fruit or other little snacks.   Now, I do have trouble sleeping, but I can live with that.   a total 9lb now"""
Trulicity,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Aside from all of the stomach issues and fatigue, this is now the second time that a box of the pens have been defective.  When you contact the company to report it, they all but call you a liar.  I will be telling my doctor to find another med.  I use other pens and have never had a problem with them.  The secondary issue is now I have used pens ahead of time in the place of defective ones and my insurance will not authorize more pens ahead of time.  The drug company did agree to do a &quot;&quot;&quot;one&quot;&quot;&quot; time replacement of the two pens.  Getting off now because this tells me I am on my own in the future."""
Exenatide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I&#039;ve been taking Bydureon for 1 month. So far, although I am skeptical by nature, it seems like a miracle. I had been eating Paleo for about 3 months, but was only losing 1 lb per week and still seeing fasting numbers around 150. My doctor put me on Bydureon and I lost 10 lbs just the in the first two weeks, and that included a few freakout days when I was eating Olive Garden, Taco Bell, and Braums ice cream multiple times per day. In one month, I&#039;ve lost a total of 21 lbs, dropping from 263lbs to 242lbs, with no other lifestyle changes. I have not been back yet to check my A1C as doc wants to wait a full three months, but posting numbers of 90 - 100 upon waking and 110 - 120 after meals, it stands to reason this would also have improved greatly."""

Trulicity,"Diabetes, Type 2","""My doctor gave me the injection in his office.  I take no other meds for my diabetes (type 2).  A1C was around 10, triglycerides were 3000, cholesterol was 541.  I also have acute pancreatitis, and later read this med was not good for this pre-existing condition.  That night after the shot, I became ill, lower back pains, an extreme full feeling in my tummy, nausea, and dizziness.  He also prescribed tricore to get my triglycerides down.  I have been sloppy with my diet, and I know what I need to do to change my eating. I honestly can say, after reading other reviews, that this drug scares me, and I wont be buying more.  629 drug interactions I read about on another site and me being fatigued and in a fog for three days, I say no more."""
Invokana,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I started Invokana three months ago after an A1C of 12. I was nervous but wanted to try it. I luckily didn&#039;t have the side effect most have  yeast infections.

Still high, I know but huge decrease from 12. I also have lost 40 lbs! I take it with Metformin &amp; Glipozide. I also am following low carb diet- most days. But, prior to Invokana, my sugar levels were high w/Metformin &amp; Glipozide &amp; very low carb diet. So, for me it&#039;s working. Hoping to get closer to 6 in next 3 months - then under 6 by a year. 
Plus, so far it&#039;s been FREE! Big time plus."""
Bydureon,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I found it to be extremely helpful and love the fact I only have to take it once a week.  I am on my 3rd week now.  The needle size is bigger yes but it does not hurt me to stick myself.  It hurts about the same as poking my finger for my blood sugar meter.  I found through the Bydureon website you can get a card to help with the copay.  Its wonderful to know there are manufacturers that are willing to help those who take their medicines.  Also if you use the freestyle meters you can sign up through Abbot to get a free meter and card to save money on the test strips. """

In other words, no nausea, increased headaches etc.. I started at .6 and after a month moved up to 1.2 where I have been since that time. I reduced my adjunct Metformin from 1500mg daily to 1000 mg daily. Weight loss has been a nice side effect, especially since it impinges on the illness in the first place. The only issue I have now is that my blood sugar can go low quite easily so will be cutting back the dose to .6 for a test run of a month. Unhealthy high levels of blood sugar are a thing of the past. Hopefully that stays the same at .6."""

Januvia,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I am taking this with Levemir and my sugar is controlled for the 1st time in ages.

Love to think about, look at and eat food but I just can&#039;t do it. It&#039;s really weird. I have lost 4 pounds from when I started this medicine and I can tell I will lose more because it is a struggle to eat. There have been 2 days that I have had to go home from work, though. Those 2 days all I could do was sleep and I just felt miserable. Yesterday was one of those days and I had a horrible headache that wouldn&#039;t go away with Advil. I&#039;ll report again in a few weeks!"""
Victoza,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Using Victoza for about 5 weeks, I feel a whole lot better generally, with stable blood glucose.

With regard to food, I eat smaller, choose better/more balanced food, I have lost around 10kg in total in this time and this alone has made a huge difference. I also consume pre/probiotics daily now and this helped with the GI disturbances.

As for side effects, I had nausea, dizzy spells, gut ache/cramps, reflux, felt rather tired in the first 2 weeks. All dissipated in the first 4 weeks. At the time I told myself I prefer to feel like this in the short term than head into a future potentially suffering from the plethora of illness brought about by Type 2 Diabetes.

Canagliflozin,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I am using this off-label as a Type 1 (I&#039;ve been a type 1 diabetic for 31 years), after I started becoming more resistant to insulin doses, probably due to also being forced to use steroids for the rest of my life.  No problems so far, have seen that my blood sugars do not go sky high from my liver dumping glucose into my system in the middle of the night.  I have not had test results yet, but I have seen a much steadier blood sugar level instead of constant swings from 30 to 500 every day like I had before.  Staying steady around 150 most the time now, so huge improvement."""

My sugar numbers stay under 120 - usually in the 90-115 range. If I take another med such as glipizide (4mg or less), my blood level drops too far down (65 to 80).  I had to stop using any other meds with Byetta. Also, you need to check you blood sugar level a few times a day until you find a healthy balance.

Also taking tiny dose of lisinopril to protect kidneys. No other side effects (never encountered any urinary issues)"""

Exenatide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I started taking Byetta 3-4 months ago. It has along with diet, metformin and amaryl, enabled me to stop all insulins, (which I was allergic to). My blood sugar has dropped from the 180-250 range to 84-120, which I am very happy about. I also was informed by my doctor that Byetta reduces fat deposits around the liver so for people who have liver disease it is very important."""

Started physical therapy to regain muscle strength.  6 months later muscle strength back, blood sugar is between 300-400.  Never went back down.  I feel horrible.

I have not noticed any negatives with victoza other than some flatus and stomach rumbling. My cravings for sugar is diminishing and I have alot of energy. I would recommend any reader to go to a dr. Who specializes in endocrinology and get a diabetic nutritionist to set up a meal plan for you. Also key is to exercise daily and stay positive.

Nausea has only happened about 3-4 times and was mild to moderate.  Blood glucose level has settled from 170 to 130 over the last 2 weeks.  Eating behaviors have changed dramatically.  Most meals are 4-5 bites and I push the plate away being fully satisfied.  It has been quite a shock learning how to eat more wisely and that I can &quot;push the plate away&quot; instead of feeling compelled to finish everything on the plate (Yes, I raised 4 kids).  I am hoping to lose about another 35-40 lbs."""

Exenatide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I dropped a Jean size. My close relatives say they have noticed some weight loss results. The nausea is awful when I eat unhealthy food. So I stick to my fruits, vegetables and lean meat. I cut out bread, white rice and other bad carbohydrates out of my diet. I only have half a cup serving of brown rice. For breakfast, I choose to eat fruits as I am a full time university student and I don&#039;t need to feel nauseated. For lunch I have a small meal, then in the evening I either eat fruits/veggies or nothing. I drink so much water...I am always thirsty lately. Again, the water seems to drain out the nausea and occasionally diarrhoea from bad food choices.

My bowel and stomach feels a lot like I need to have an evacuation but I&#039;ve not had diarrhea. As for weight loss I&#039;ve gone from over 17 stone to 14st 7lbs in 3 months without doing anything. My Hbc1a has dropped from over 25 to around 7.. So everything is pretty amazing. I&#039;m lucky that it&#039;s free for me in UK but it did take a few years to get it prescribed by my diabetic specialist nurse.
