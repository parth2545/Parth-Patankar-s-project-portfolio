# Parth Patankar's project portfolio
This repository is my portfolio of various projects completed on data science, machine learning, Android app, data mining, web development for the academic, self idea, and professional purposes. I hope you find it interesting.

## Projects
 - #### Machine learning & data mining
  
      -  [Predicting ethnicity from names for marketing](https://github.com/parth2545/Parth-Patankar-s-project-portfolio/tree/main/Predicting%20ethnicity%20from%20names%20for%20marketing) : A machine learning model to predict the person's ethnicity from their name to use in specific target marketing. It identifies if the person is Asian – Indian /Asian – East Asian / Hispanic /White non-Hispanic or Black non-Hispanic. We have used [LSTM](https://github.com/parth2545/Parth-Patankar-s-project-portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20ethnicity%20from%20names%20for%20marketing/LSTM_Single_alphabet.ipynb), [SVM](https://github.com/parth2545/Parth-Patankar-s-project-portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20ethnicity%20from%20names%20for%20marketing/SVM_model.ipynb), and [NBC](https://github.com/parth2545/Parth-Patankar-s-project-portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20ethnicity%20from%20names%20for%20marketing/NBC_Name_model.ipynb) models to find out the best fitting model.
      
      -  [Text Mining to classify reviews:](https://github.com/parth2545/Parth-Patankar-s-project-portfolio/tree/main/Text%20Mining%20to%20classify%20reviews) A model for understanding and classifying medicine reviews into positive and negative. Unstructured text data is processed to find meaningful information to improve the product.
      
      -  [Predicting conversion rate on an E-commerce website:](https://github.com/parth2545/Parth-Patankar-s-project-portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20conversion%20rate%20on%20an%20E-commerce%20website/Predicting_conversion_rate_on_an_E_commerce_website%20(2).ipynb) With the help of decision tree ensembles, we created models to predict if the person visiting a website will make a successful transaction or not with the help of variables like amount spend on the website, bounce rate, time, and month of the year, special day, etc. This will help businesses identify the problems in the website and improve customer retention rate, resulting in higher sales and revenue.
     
     -  [Finding quality of beverage](https://github.com/parth2545/Parth-Patankar-s-project-portfolio/tree/main/Finding%20quality%20of%20beverage): Using random forest classification model to predict if the drink is of good or bad quality with the help of proportion of 7 main ingredients of the drink.

 - #### Android app
 
      -  Double check App : Double Check is an app created to fight against the spread of fake information. We promote that we should always check everything twice before believing and sharing it. There are 100's of fake tweet and fake news generator tools out there, which can create a highly believable post, edited tweet and memes. These images can be highly misleading and manipulating. We solve that problem for you. With a DOUBLE CHECK app, on one click, you can check if the tweet in front of you is really done by the person or its fake /edited. Also, you will be able to instantly search any info without any efforts and switching between apps. Link :https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PS.doublecheck

  - #### Big Data

      - Hadoop Migration Tool : Managed and developed the "Hadoop Migration Tool" project for a company. A tool to simplify managing data on clusters in Hadoop by simple drag and drop technique. Automation is done to eliminate the coding process and the need to know complex Hadoop commands. The application was developed using Javascript & HTML on the front-end and Plink, .Bat file, and Hadoop API at the back-end.

- #### Data visualization

     -  HSE National Ambulance and fire brigade service's data analysis: First responders are medically trained professionals Who, in most cases, are the first to arrive on the scene of emergencies and accidents. We identified the current situation of the emergency services in Dublin & analyzed the challenges these service stations face to find a data-driven solution to this critical problem.

     - Fifa 19 : Sports analysis is one of the huge things when people worldwide could demonstrate that they could win a league by data analyzing and statistical moves. Football is one of the most-watched and loved games in the world. Many people play online games and fantasy league games to enjoy and be part of the game. I created these dashboards to understand the team and player statistics to make the right decisions in a fantasy league.

- #### Micro Projects

  -   [Bulk email using python[(https://github.com/parth2545/Parth-Patankar-s-project-portfolio/tree/main/Bulk%20email%20using%20python) : A web-based application to send bulk emails to clients to notify changes in gov system and rules using flask, python, and HTML.
