# Finding quality of beverage

We have used a drink dataset with different variables ( components of drink) to find out the quality of the drink. We are creating a classification random forest model to predict the quality of drink as poor or excellent. This prediction will help a drink company to remove the poor quality product before packaging to improve customer satisfaction. We are also using PCA and Kmeans clustering for visualisation.
